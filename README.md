# Boredom Buster

# Description
Ever feel bored, like you want to do something, but you don't know what you want to do? Our application can solve that problem. 
Search for a date and the application will recommend a few activities based on the weather for you to do.

# User Story 
Once a user loads up the page, a description of the application is displayed. A user has the option to sign up or log in. 

Upon clicking the SIGN UP button, the user is prompted to enter name, email address, and a password (minimum of 8 characters). 
Upon clicking the LOGIN button, the user is prompted to enter email address and password. 

Once logged on, the user is taken to the ACTIVITIES SEARCH page. The user can choose a date within a 5 day window. Depending on the weather, certain activities will pop-up on the screen along with the temperature and weather. Users search histories are automatically saved. 

A user can access search history by clicking the SEARCH HISTORY button. Users can also log out at any time.
